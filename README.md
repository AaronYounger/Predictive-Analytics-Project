# Predictive-Analytics-Project
     This project serves as a demonstration of applied knowledge in key predictive analytics concepts and techniques. This project consists of three separate reports, each report tied to a unique dataset. To meet the project criteria, each dataset was required to be publicly available, include a data dictionary or metadata, support the formulation of an interesting and relevant business problem, and originate from a real, non-synthetic source. Each report was structured using the phases of the CRISP-DM Methodolgy. The CRISP-DM methodology is widely used for data science and data mining projects as it provides a structured, flexible, and business-focused framework that aligns analytical work back to the business problem. The six phases of the CRISP-DM Methodolgy include Business Understanding, Data Understanding, Data Preperation, Model Development, Model Evaluation, and Deployment. Alongside the three reports, ethical considerations were explored, focusing on data collection and storage practices within the relevant sectors of the data sets and the ethical principles outlined in the Data Science Code of Conduct. This project was developed using R and the IDE RStudio. 
     To present the three reports, this repository includes three Quarto (.qmd) files containing the R code and three corresponding PDF files that display the rendered output. Each report focuses on a single modeling objective. One report will utlize classification models to answer a categorical/binary business problem, one report will just utilize regression-based models to answer a continuous/numeric business problem, and the final report will utilize time-series models to predict future observations. Below is a brief explanation of what I did for each of these reports.

## Classification Report
     The Classification report followed the six phases of the CRISP-DM methodology starting with Business Understanding. The Business Problem Statement that the analysis set out to answer was how to identify which clients are more likely to subscribe to a term deposit. The dataset used for this  classification report orginated from a bank. Banks benefit from predicting which clients are most likely to subscribe to term deposits because it enables more targeted and effective marketing, reducing marketing costs while allowing banks to focus on customer segments with higher subscription likelihood, increasing revenue. In the Data Understanding phase I split EDA into categorical and Numeric EDA. My categorical EDA found issues with level and class imbalance while my numeric EDA found issues with distribution and correlation. For my Data Preparation phase I removed extreme outliers to help with variable distribution and partitioned my data for modeling. The models explored in this project include classification trees, k-nearest neighbors (KNN), and logistic regression, each of which required distinct data preparation and dataset partitioning approaches. In the modeling phase, the model that was explored first was classification trees. An unweighted and weighted classification tree was made with the weighted classification tree being the best model as it had the best discriminatory power between the two classes of the dependent variable. The second set of models consisted of k-nearest neighbors (KNN) models, including unweighted, oversampled, and threshold-tuned variants. Among these, the threshold-tuned KNN model performed best, demonstrating the strongest discriminatory power between the two classes of the dependent variable. The last set of models consisted of an unweighted and weighted Logistic Regression model. the weighted logistic regression model was the best as it had the strongest discriminatory power between the two classes of the dependent variable. In the evaluation phase, the top-performing models were compared to determine which would be selected for deployment to address the business problem. Among the weighted classification tree, threshold-tuned KNN model, and weighted logistic regression, the weighted logistic regression model the best performer, achieving the highest balanced accuracy and demonstrating strong discriminatory power through a well-balanced sensitivity and specificity. In the deployment phase, the weighted logistic regression model was used to answer the business problem. The weighted logistic regression model provides banks with a practical decision support tool to reduce marketing costs while increasing revenue by targeting customers with a higher likelihood of subscribing to a term deposit.
